# Kotlin EXtended library

KEX is a collection of handy extensions, classes and functions
that should have been in Kotlin STDlib, but still not there.

It includes:
* Collection builders
* Extensions for encoding
* Nullability extensions (for example, to work with Boolean)
* Resources object to get packed resources easy and concise
* etc.
